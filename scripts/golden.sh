# Two fixtures, because the SSH Keypair Standard has two modes and a package
# conforms only if both hold. `colors.yml` is keygen mode (no vultr-ssh-keys):
# the compute template must declare the profile-named vultr_ssh_key resource
# and reference it by attribute. `optout.yml` supplies an explicit key id and
# must render the historical shape, byte for byte, creating nothing.
#
# Keygen paths are rendered from a fixed placeholder home on :build, never from
# $HOME, so these goldens mean the same thing on every workstation.
